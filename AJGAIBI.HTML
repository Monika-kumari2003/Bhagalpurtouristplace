        <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"  ><FONT FACE="SLOGAND" SIZE="5" COLOR="BROWM">The origin of the temple is shrouded in mystery. According to the legend lord Shiva took a bow known as Ajgav and so the place came to be known as Ajgaivinath. It is commonly said that Kalapahar failed to demolish Ajgaivinath temple, but he could destroy the Parvati temple on the neighbouring hill and built a mosque there. Formerly, this hill must have been bigger and spacious. The high floods and the constant strong currents of the Ganga must have worn away the decaying granite rocks of the hill. The present village Jahangira to the west of Sultangang still keeps alive the memory of the Ashram of Jahnu Muni. The name of Jahangira appears to be the distorted form of Jahnugiri (the hill of Jahnu) or Jahnu griha (the abode of Jahnu).

            During the rule of the Mauryas, Guptas and Palas many works of art and architecture were raised at Sultanganj. The area has yielded ancient relics like stupas, seals, coins, terracotta and Hindu and Buddha images. Many carvings can still be seen in the Sultanganj hills. A number of small images along with a copper image of Lord Buddha about seven feet high were excavated here. A Buddha image found in Sultanganj is now in Birmingham Museum.
            
            Bhagalpur, JNN. Baba Budhanath Temple is an invaluable heritage of faith. Its glory story is very ancient. This temple, located on the banks of the Ganges, which has fallen on the earth, is world famous in the eyes of the devotees.
