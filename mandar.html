        <p><font face="Monotype Corsiva" style="bold" size="5"><center>Mandar Hill, a panoramic landscape of 800 ft high granite hill situated 50 KM from Bhagalpur city, is associated with legendry amritmanthana or churning of nectar from the sea. Legend has it that the hill was used by Gods to churn the ocean for procuring nectar. Basuki Nag, a holy snake, offered himself to serve as the rope, and the hill has an impression of the coil on it. Puranas also hold that while Lord Vishnu covering the Universe in three steps as Vamana Avatar put his one step at Vishnupad Hill and the other at Mandar Hill.

        <p align="justify"><font face="arail" size="3" color="blue">The mountain has many references in Hindu Mythology as Mandarachal Parvat. As per references found in the Puranas and the Mahabharata, this hill was used for churning the ocean to extract the nectar from its bosom (Samudra Manthan). There is, adjacent to this hill, a pond called "Paapharni". This holy pond has its own historical significance. It is a place where you can revive yourself after taking a bath in the pond that refreshes you mentally and physically. In the middle of the pond is a temple of Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi.

            Many rare sculptures of Lord Shiva, Kamadhenu and Varaha, believed to be of 11-12th century AD, can be found to be scattered around Mandar Hill. These rare artifacts need to be conserved by Archaeological Survey of India.[3]</font></p>
